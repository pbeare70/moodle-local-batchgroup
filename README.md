## Batchgroup local plugin
#### Description ###
This is a local Moodle plug in, used to upload a CSV file of usernames and groups names so that the users can be allocated en masse to the specified groups.
This plug-in is adapted from: https://moodle.org/plugins/local_userenrols by Fred Woolard


### Example CSV file format:

    student001, Group A
    student002, Group A
    student003, Group A
    student004, Group B
    student005, Group B
    student005, Group B
